# MemoryGame
Java program that sets up a memory game using JFrame, JPanel, Timers and action listeners. 
The game will have one "joker" card that is showed whenever it is selected and remains static afterwards. 
The game will allow the user to select a card, wait until the selection of the next card, compare both of them, if they match the cards will remain displayed, and if they don't match, both selected cards will be hidden again. 
There will be a start and a reset cardButton.

Missing: Timer to delay the card flip to a few seconds after recognizing an incorrect match.
