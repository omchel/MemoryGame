# MemoryGame
Java program that sets up a memory game using JFrame, JPanel, Timers and action listeners. 
- The game has one "joker" card that is shown whenever it is selected and remains static afterwards. 
- The game allows the user to select a card, wait until the selection of the next card, compare both of them, if they match the cards will remain displayed, and if they don't match, both selected cards will be hidden again. 

Missing: Timer to delay the card flip to a few seconds after recognizing an incorrect match.
